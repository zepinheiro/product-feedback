# Backend

This project is build with express and node js. It's a simple web server that allows the user to create new products and it's related reviews.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the server in dev mode.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app into `build` folder so it can be later served.

## What is missing

Due to time constraints and being a `FE` exercise I left the unit tests out of the server.
On another iteration I would like to implement pagination to improve FE and BE performance.
